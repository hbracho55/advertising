# advertising
Implement a REST service for managing listings for online advertising service.

Terminology
Listing - a vehicle ad, usually consists of information about a vehicle and some other information, like who is selling a car, price, posting date, etc. Listing can be in one of two possible states:
published - available online or
draft - not available online.
Car Dealer - a business that sells new or used cars.
Tier Limit - a number of published listings a dealer can have online.
Requirements
Service should implement following functionality:

Create a listing. All the created listings should have state draft by default;
Update a listing;
Get all listings of a dealer with a given state;
Publish a listing;
Unpublish a listing.
Please note that the number of published listings for a dealer should be less or equal to the dealer's tier limit. When publishing a listing, client should be able to choose how to deal with situation when tier limit is reached - either

return an error to the client, or
publish a listing, but unpublish the oldest listing of a dealer to conform to the tier limit.
Come up with an additional functionality of your choice that could give value to the service.

Notes
Our tech stack is mostly Java with Spring framework.
Please create a 'production-ready' service as you see it (documentation / tests / logs / exception handling).
Please provide an instruction on how to run the app.
Submit your solution either as a public repository (github, gitlab etc.) or as a zip archive.
